# Movie-Recommendation-System

CD & DVD, TV, Projects or recording all of these are all things of the past. All of the world's  biggest film collections have been digitalized and moved to online streaming services like Netflix, HBO, YouTube, these platform can help us with the most difficult tasks of all choosing a movie. They have been enhanced with AI-powered capabilities.

To create advanced predective system for true movie experts Data Scientists investigate our behavioral patterns and those of movies. A movie recommendation system, also known as movie recommender system, uses machine learning (ML) to predict or filter users film preferences based on their prior decisions and actions. It is a advanced filteration system that anticipate the consumer in question potential like selection for a domain specific item (a movie).

Every recommender primarily consists of two components users and items. User recieve more prediction from the system and the actual movies are the products, filtering and predicting only the movies that are matching user is mostly likely wish to see in the main objective of movie recommendation system. The user information from the system database is used by  the ML algorithm for these recommendation system based on information from the past . This  data is used to forecast the user in questions behavior in the future, data should be handled by expert because it is so curcial to ML projects including the movie recommendation system.

There are two types of filtering techniques most commonly used in movie recommendation system namely, Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. 
Content-Based Filtering is a method of filtering movies in a movie recommendation that uses information taken from the user. This techniques uses an ML algorithm to suggest movies that are comparable to the users past choices. Therefore the information about the prior movie choices and likes of a person is used to generate similarity in content-based filtering.
Collaborative Filtering technique is based on the interaction between the two users. For best outcomes the system compares these behaviour, it combines movie choices and user patterns of several people like there are two types of collaborative filtering algorithm :
1. Collaborative filtering based on users : the goal is to find patterns and targeted users and other database users,
2. Collaborative item based filtering : finding comparable movies that targeted users rate or interact about.
